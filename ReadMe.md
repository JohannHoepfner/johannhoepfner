### Good morning! I am Johann Höpfner
I am a 14 years old German student interested in maths, information technologies and physics as well as engineering.  
Being approximately one sixth  of the German <a href="https://www.f1inschools.de/">F1inSchools</a> Team <a href="https://github.com/Celerius-Racing">Celerius Racing</a> I currently mostly work on our the CAD construction.
My favourite programming language is C# while I use Python for calculator-like tasks.
